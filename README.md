# AI-Project4-LearningTrees
 create images of learning trees from csv files.

This program requires the user to install Jupyter Notebook and Graphviz.
 To do this use the commands:
 "pip3 install graphviz"
 "pip3 install jupyter"

Then the user must, within their command line terminal, move to the StudentBehaviors directory and run the command:
 "py StudentBehaviors.py"
This will display the graph of the image in a seperate window, and save it to the StudentBehaiors directory.
